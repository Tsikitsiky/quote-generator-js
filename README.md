# This is my random quote generator

In this exercice, I have created a quote generator.

In order to achive it I :

1. first created three arrays of quotes, and a function that shows a quote which is a combination of three sentences from the three arrays when it is called.

1. then created a prompt where the user can specify the number of quotes between 1 to 5 they want to see.

1. finaly wanted to create a prompt to ask the user from which quote generator they want, as we can see I put them in comment as the time ended. I also created two objects of arrays but unforunatly I could not achieve it until the end.
