# This is my random quote generator

In this exercice, I have created a quote generator.

In order to achive it I :

1. first created three arrays of quotes, and a function that shows a quote which is a combination of three sentences from the three arrays when it is called.

1. then created a prompt where the user can specify the number of quotes between 1 to 5 they want to see.

1. next I created an object which takes three arrays as properties, and a function that concatenates a new quotes from the arrays.

1. after that I created a prompt which asks the user to choose a quote generator since there are two generators and console the quotes after the choice.

1. I finally created a prompt that asks the user whether they want more quotes, and if they do, it goes back to ask for choosing a generator.
